# Codex-Kernel

Codex mainly focuses on stability and security. The main aim of this kernel is to always be up to date with CAF upstream.  

## Bugs that needs to be addressed
- ###### Ì¶~~WiFi~~
- ###### ~~Camera (Broken source by Xiaomi)~~
- ###### ~~Torch (Broken source by Xiaomi)~~
- ###### ~~Brightness (Stays bright even in low brightness, again by Xiaomi)~~

## Bugs addressed so far
- ###### WiFi
- ###### Camera
- ###### Torch/Flashlight
- ###### Brightness

## Note

- The above mentioned bugs(that are addressed excluding WiFi) are tested on ROMs that aren't based on MIUI 9.5.11 blobs. So if you intend to try the kernel on a ROM (say based on MIUI 9.5.11 blobs), then you may expect the bugs as mentioned above.

## Need some features?
Ah, everyone likes to experience new features. If you want me to add something new, let me know. I'll always look into users concerns though I can't guarantee in adding them (if they break the stability).
